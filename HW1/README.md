1 Stats and Data: 

  geretate bernoulli 30 times, calculate the probability P(Y_bar>0.5), generate p_hat, generate through Normal distribution

2 Regression Comparison: 

  Write a program to take a data set and t a decision tree to it
  Repeat the experiment, but instead of truncating the tree by depth, truncate by sample size 
  Compare: Truncating by depth or truncating by sample size better for minimizing error
  Write a program to take a data set and t a linear model to it
  when fit a model, look at the weight on each feature and  try to eliminate super uous features
